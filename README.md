# WallaceTheme
Wallace is an experimental WordPress blogging theme built with the Rest API and Angular2. It is no longer under active development.

Wallace uses an API-first approach for rendering both on the server and client. You get all the performance of a single page app with all the SEO benefits and wp-admin compatibility of a traditional server-rendered theme. 

**Notice: Master branch may contain unstable code. Use a tagged release if you need stability.** 

**Notice: Requires WordPress version 4.7 or higher and "pretty" permalinks. Some plugins may be incompatible with this theme - particularly those that make heavy modifications to the structure of the site like page builders. Plugins that only modify the data of a website (rather than its structure) and plugins that introduce code to the `<head>` and `<footer>` (like an SEO plugin) should work properly.** 

This project is under active development and updates may introduce breaking changes or changes that alter the structure and design of your site. If you prefer, you can wait for a more stable 2.0 release. 

## Instructions for non-technical users
